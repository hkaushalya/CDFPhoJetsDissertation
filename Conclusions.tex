Searches for new physics typically begin with a particular model. One selects a region in the data where the model's expected contribution is enhanced. Given the large number of theoretical models, however, it is useful to search for new physics broadly in a large region of phase space.  The purpose of this thesis is to perform a model-independent search for new physics in photon + jets events.

%There are many models that predict such a signature. In case of deviation of data from the Standard Model predictions, It will not give us much information about a particular model.

In this thesis, we present results of the search for new physics in \phoonejet and \photwojet events with and without a \met~$>$ 20~GeV requirement. The backgrounds of such a signature can be divided into two categories. The first category consists of backgrounds from Standard Model processes in \ppbar collisions including direct photon production, diphoton production, QCD, and processes that fake a prompt photon. The second category consists of non-collision backgrounds including cosmic rays and the beam halo.

We developed two different background prediction methods, Method A and Method B. Each method has been proven to describe the $\gamma$ + jets data with certain limitations. We conclude that the two methods together provide a greater understanding of data than either method alone. Thus far, we see good agreement with Standard Model predictions extending over several orders of magnitude. The search for new heavy particles in high-\et events has shown no significant deviation from data. Furthermore, the search for a narrow resonance has shown no indication of the presence of heavy particles decaying to $\gamma$ + jets. We conclude that all of our measurements are in agreement with Standard Model expectations.

%This type of analysis can be done at the LHC searches where the high energies matters.

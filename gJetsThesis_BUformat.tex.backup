\acknowledgements{

I would like to start by expressing my sincere gratitude to my advisor Dr. Jay Dittmann for his continuous support of my Ph.D. study and research, and for his patience, advice, motivation, sharing his knowledge and supporting me during difficult times.

I am ever in debt to Dr. Raymond Culberston and Dr. Sasha Pronko at Fermilab for their continuous support and advice without which this analysis would have been impossible. I am very thankful for their time spent joining regular meetings and numerous private discussions. I also want to thank Dr. Nils Krumnack who guided me when I was starting this study at the Femilab. I am grateful for Dr. Azeddine Kasmi for his invaluable support and encouragement.

I would like to thank the members of my thesis committee: Prof. Gregory Benesh, Prof. Wickramasinghe Ariyasinghe, Prof. Kenichi Hatakeyama, and Prof. David Ryden, for their invaluable comments and suggestions.

I am very grateful to Prof. Benesh, the faculty and staff of the Physics Department for giving me the oppertunity to excel and for their continuous support. I want to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Ariyasinghe for getting me through tough times and being there for me and my family. Many thanks to Prasanga and Dr. Robert Flowers for their invaluable friendship and help. I would like thank all my friends Martin, Karen, and Zhenbin for their company and help.

Last but not least, I thank my family for their support and encouragement. I thank my parents without whom this journey would have not started. Much thanks to my wife who waited patiently throughout and supported me at every step. Many thanks to my daughters and son for their love and keeping me sane through the hard times.

%\chapter{Poisson Statistics}
%In scattering experiments the events generated are rare and independent of any other event that is generated. Hence, the experiments are better described by {\bf Poisson Statistics}.

%A {\bf Poisson experiment is a statistical experiment} that has the following properties:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item {The event can be counted in whole numbers}
%\item {Occurance of any event is indepenent of any other event. i.e. occurance of an event does not increase or decreaser the chance of another.}
%\item {The average frequency of occurance for a given time period is known}
%\item {last}
%\end{enumerate}

%The Poisson distribution is given by

%\begin{eqnarray*}
%p_{\mu}(\nu) &=& e^{-\mu} \frac{\mu^{\nu}}{\nu!}\\
%p_{\mu} &=& \mathrm{\nu~events~in~any~definite~time~interval} \\
%\mu &=& \mathrm{average~number~of~events~expected} \\
%\end{eqnarray*}
